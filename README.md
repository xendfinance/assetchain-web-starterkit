# Scaffold-AssetChain ⛓️‍💥

Scaffold-AssetChain is a fork of Scaffold-ETH-2 ready to ship to AssetChain . This fork provides native support for AssetChain testnet, direct access to the AssetChain faucets


We highly recommend the Scaffold-ETH-2 docs as the primary guideline.

# (forked from 🏗 Scaffold-ETH-2)

🧪 An open-source, up-to-date toolkit for building decentralized applications (dapps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It's designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

⚙️ Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

- ✅ **Contract Hot Reload**: Your frontend auto-adapts to your smart contract as you edit it.
- 🪝 **[Custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/)**: Collection of React hooks wrapper around [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to simplify interactions with smart contracts with typescript autocompletion.
- 🧱 [**Components**](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/): Collection of common web3 components to quickly build your frontend.
- 🔥 **Burner Wallet & Local Faucet**: Quickly test your application with a burner wallet and local faucet.
- 🔐 **Integration with Wallet Providers**: Connect to different wallet providers and interact with the Ethereum network.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-Base, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/xendfinance/scaffold-assetchain
cd scaffold-assetchain
yarn install
```

You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

2. To deploy your contracts directly to `assetchain`

```
cd hardhat
yarn deploy --network assetchain_testnet
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

**What's next**:

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`. For guidance on [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and configuring [pages/layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) checkout the Next.js documentation.
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
- Edit your smart contract test in: `packages/hardhat/test`. To run test use `yarn hardhat:test`


Reset your deployment 
```
yarn deploy --reset
```


For interacting with contracts, you can nicely use [scaffold-eth custom hooks](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/) (wrappers around wagmi) or wagmi hooks directly without needing to change anything.
